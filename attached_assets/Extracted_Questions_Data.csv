18,Is Amikacin (Aminoglycosides) an example of a Watch antibiotic?,yes,No,,,2,Amikacin belongs to the Access group in spite of it’s potential side effects. It’s classified in this group due to it’s relatively low potential for inducing antimicrobial resistance when compared to other antibiotics.
19,Do Watch antibiotics have a higher potential for developing resistance compared to Access antibiotics?,yes,No,,,1,Watch antibiotics require closer monitoring due to their resistance potential.
